In all the random tests i acheived 100% line coverage with only 42 tests. For randomtestcard1 and randomtestcard2 i also got 100% 
branch covereage. For randomtest adventurer I only got 55% branch coverage. The random testing has a better chance of finding 
faults because it can use so many different inouts very quickly to find what will fail. You also get better coverage with 
random testing as it will explore "all" possiblilities with more and more tests.

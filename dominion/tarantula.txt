To test find a bug with tarantula testing i first added a bug to the minion card in dominion.c. The bug is on line 987 
it gives the player one coin instead of two. Type "make tarantula" to run the script. minion_tarantula.c is a random tester of the minion 
card. This is run 100 times by tarantula.py to give suspiciousness data. After running the script it is graphically clear that line 987
is the most suspicious because it has the longest line of #### and has a suspisiousness rating of 1. Tarantula was a very clear way to locate this bug.

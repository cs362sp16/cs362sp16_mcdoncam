Assignment 2 
Bugs: Bugs with drawing cards for the smithy, failing assert 

For all my unit tests i basically created a game of dominion and a copy game. I would then call a function in one game
(like drawCard or discardCard) and check it with the copy of the game to see if I got the desired result.
